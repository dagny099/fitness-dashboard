## Critical Data Quality Issue Identified

### **Problem: Unreliable Activity Type Labels**
**Context**: Blog article analysis reveals activity_type column contains mixed data:
- Labels like "Interval Run" represent both actual runs (8-12 min/mile) and walks (20-28 min/mile)
- Post-June 2018 "Choco Effect" created bimodal workout distribution
- Current analysis averages are contaminated (e.g., "6.50 min/mile average pace" mixing runs + walks)

### **Impact on Intelligence Quality:**
- Trend analysis shows false patterns due to mixed activity types
- Performance forecasting unreliable with contaminated baseline data
- Anomaly detection triggers false positives
- User insights misleading without activity separation

### **Validation from Blog Article:**
User's narrative analysis identified clear clusters:
- **"Real Runs"**: 8-12 min/mile, 3-8 miles, 30-70 minutes (14% of post-2018 workouts)
- **"Choco Adventures"**: 20-28 min/mile, 1-3 miles, 20-90 minutes (76% of post-2018 workouts)

- **Decision**: Adopted K-means with confidence scoring for transparency

### **Experiment 2: Database Storage vs In-Memory Classification**  
- **Hypothesis**: In-memory classification would be fast enough for real-time analysis
- **Method**: Tested classification performance on 2,409 workout dataset with caching

## Database Integration Strategy

### **Current Schema**: `workout_summary` table
```sql
workout_date, activity_type, kcal_burned, distance_mi, duration_sec, 
avg_pace, max_pace, steps, link
```

### **Enhancement Options:**

**Option A: Virtual Classification (RECOMMENDED)**
- Calculate classification on-demand during analysis
- No schema changes required
- Classification cached in memory for session duration
- Maintains data integrity, easier rollback

**Option B: Add Classification Columns**
```sql
ALTER TABLE workout_summary ADD COLUMN predicted_activity_type VARCHAR(20);
ALTER TABLE workout_summary ADD COLUMN classification_confidence DECIMAL(3,2);
```
- Permanent storage of classification results
- Faster queries, no recalculation needed
- Requires database migration, harder to modify algorithms
