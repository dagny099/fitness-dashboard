# Public Documentation Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to deploy the public-friendly version of your Fitness Dashboard documentation.

## What's Been Created

### 📁 `docs-public/` Directory
A sanitized version of your documentation with sensitive information removed:
- ✅ Removed specific domain names, passwords, and endpoints
- ✅ Generalized production deployment details
- ✅ Kept all educational and technical content
- ✅ Maintained professional appearance and structure

### 📄 `mkdocs-public.yml`
A public-friendly MkDocs configuration that:
- Points to the `docs-public` directory
- Uses generic site URL placeholders
- Maintains all the professional theming and features

## Quick Deployment to Netlify

### Step 1: Build the Public Documentation
```bash
mkdocs build -f mkdocs-public.yml
```
This creates a `site/` directory with static HTML files.

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up (free)
2. Click "Add new site" > "Deploy manually"
3. Drag and drop the `site/` folder from your project
4. Get instant live URL like: `https://fitness-dashboard-docs.netlify.app`

### Step 3: Custom Domain (Optional)
- In Netlify dashboard, go to Site settings > Domain management
- Add custom domain like `docs.workouts.barbhs.com`
- Follow DNS setup instructions

## What's Been Sanitized

### 🔒 Security Information Removed:
- Specific domain names (`workouts.barbhs.com` → `your-domain.com`)
- Database passwords and connection strings
- Detailed production deployment scripts
- Server configuration files with sensitive paths
- RDS endpoints and AWS-specific details

### ✅ Educational Content Preserved:
- Complete user guides and tutorials
- Architecture diagrams and explanations
- API documentation and code examples
- Database schema and query examples
- Installation and setup procedures
- Troubleshooting guides

## Maintaining Public Docs

### Regular Updates
```bash
# Make changes to docs-public/
# Build updated version
mkdocs build -f mkdocs-public.yml

# Deploy to Netlify
# Just drag-drop the new site/ folder
```

### Syncing Changes from Main Docs
```bash
# Copy specific files you want to make public
cp docs/new-feature.md docs-public/
# Edit to remove any sensitive info
# Rebuild and redeploy
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 🌐 **Public Benefits:**
- Professional documentation showcases your development skills
- Helps users understand and adopt your fitness dashboard
- Contributes to open source community
- Improves project discoverability

### 🛡️ **Security Benefits:**
- No production secrets or sensitive configuration exposed
- Keeps your main repository private
- Educational content without operational details
- Generic examples that don't reveal your infrastructure

## Alternative Deployment Options

### GitHub Pages (if you upgrade to Pro)
```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy -f mkdocs-public.yml
```

### Your Own Server
```bash
mkdocs build -f mkdocs-public.yml
# Upload site/ folder to your web server
```

### Vercel or Other Static Hosts
Similar to Netlify - just upload the `site/` folder

Your documentation is now ready for public deployment while keeping your sensitive information private! 🚀
