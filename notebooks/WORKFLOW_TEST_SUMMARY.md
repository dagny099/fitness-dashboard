# Notebook Workflow Test Summary

## ✅ Test Results (September 12, 2025)

### 📊 Data Files Created and Validated
- **`data/sample_workouts.csv`**: 45 workouts spanning 2019-2023
  - 4 activity types: Running (19), Walking (15), Mixed Activity (6), Outlier (5)
  - Includes representative examples of the "Choco Effect" behavioral shift
  
- **`data/choco_effect_demo.csv`**: 25 workouts demonstrating phase transitions
  - Pre-choco phase: 10 workouts (2018-2019, running focus)
  - Post-choco phase: 10 workouts (2021-2022, walking focus)  
  - Transition phase: 5 workouts (2020, mixed activities)
  - Clear 5.2 min/mile pace difference demonstrating behavioral shift

- **`data/ambiguous_cases.csv`**: 15 workouts showcasing classification complexity
  - Each case includes `ambiguity_reason` explaining why it's difficult to classify
  - Examples: pace variance, run/walk intervals, terrain effects, weather impacts

### 🧠 Machine Learning Core Functions Validated
- **K-means clustering**: Successfully clusters 45 workouts into 4 groups
- **Feature engineering**: 4-dimensional feature space (kcal, distance, duration, steps)
- **Data preprocessing**: StandardScaler normalization working correctly
- **Classification distribution**: Realistic cluster sizes [25, 15, 3, 2]
