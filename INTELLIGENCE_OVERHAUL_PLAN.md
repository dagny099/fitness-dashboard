# 🎯 AI Intelligence Dashboard Overhaul Plan
**Date:** October 4, 2025
**Branch:** `feature/intelligence-dashboard-overhaul`
**Goal:** Remove BS, add real insights, make it fun and useful for Runs vs Walks analysis

---

## 🚨 RISKS & MITIGATION

### Identified Risks:
1. **MAJOR RISK**: Removing sections that other pages might depend on
   - **Mitigation**: Keep removed functions as `_legacy` versions temporarily, verify no imports elsewhere

2. **Data dependency risk**: Goal tracker requires specific data columns
   - **Mitigation**: Add defensive null checks, fallback to graceful degradation

3. **Performance risk**: Scatter plot with 1000+ workouts could be slow
   - **Mitigation**: Sample to max 500 points if dataset > 500, add loading indicators

4. **Git history loss risk**: Repeating the mistake of losing uncommitted work
   - **Mitigation**:
     - Create feature branch FIRST
     - Commit after each major section (6 commits planned)
     - Push to remote after each commit

## 📂 FILE CHANGES

### Files to Modify:
1. `src/views/intelligence.py` - Major overhaul (70% rewrite)
2. `src/utils/goal_tracker.py` - Use as-is, no changes needed

### Files to Create:
1. `INTELLIGENCE_OVERHAUL_PLAN.md` - This plan document
2. No new Python files needed

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Setup & Cleanup (Commit 1)
**Branch Creation & Initial Cleanup**

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/intelligence-dashboard-overhaul`
2. Save this plan as `INTELLIGENCE_OVERHAUL_PLAN.md`
3. Remove page-specific sidebar code (lines 1569-1606 in `render_algorithm_transparency_sidebar()`)
4. Remove these entire functions:
   - `render_forecasting_analysis_section()` (lines 934-1110)
   - `render_classification_demo()` (lines 1404-1444)
   - `render_classification_reasoning()` (lines 1446-1516)
   - `render_classification_controls()` (lines 1518-1567)
5. Commit: "Phase 1: Remove BS features and page-specific sidebar"

---

### Phase 2: Performance Analysis with Colored Cards (Commit 2)
**Replace plain metrics with beautiful colored cards**

**REMOVE:**
- Lines 685-713: Current plain `st.metric()` calls

**ADD:**
- `render_performance_cards_by_type()` function:
  - Blue card for Runs (background: `#e3f2fd`, border: `#1976d2`)
  - Green card for Walks (background: `#e8f5e9`, border: `#388e3c`)
  - Each card shows:
    - Count, Total Distance, Avg Distance
    - Avg Pace, Pace Range (min/max)
    - Total Duration, Avg Duration
    - Total Calories, Avg Calories
  - Comparison arrows vs previous period (rolling window)
  - Format: "Last 7 days vs Previous 7 days"

**Commit:** "Phase 2: Add colored performance cards for Runs vs Walks"

---

### Phase 3: Personalized Goals Section (Commit 3)
**Integrate goal_tracker.py into dashboard**

**ADD NEW FUNCTION:** `render_personalized_goals_section(brief, time_period)`

**Location:** After Performance Analysis, before Consistency Analysis

**Features:**
- Goal setting UI:
  - Pace goal slider (e.g., "Run avg pace < 9.5 min/mi")
  - Distance goal slider (e.g., "Walk at least 2.5 mi per workout")
  - Frequency goal slider (e.g., "3+ runs per week")
- Achievement cards by activity type:
  - "🏃 Run Goals: 12/15 workouts met pace goal (80%)"
  - "🚶 Walk Goals: 8/10 workouts met distance goal (80%)"
- Visual progress bars
- Comparison to previous period

**Integration:**
- Import `GoalTracker` from `src/utils/goal_tracker.py`
- Use session state to persist goal settings
- Calculate achievements using classified workouts

**Commit:** "Phase 3: Add Personalized Goals section with goal tracking"

---

### Phase 4: Consistency Analysis Overhaul (Commit 4)
**Replace opaque score with real insights**

**REMOVE:**
- Lines 820-875: Opaque consistency score display

**ADD:**
- Two-column layout:
  - **Left: Frequency & Patterns**
    - "Averaging 3.2 runs/week (up from 2.8/week last period)"
    - Day-of-week heatmap showing workout distribution
    - Peak workout days highlighted
  - **Right: Streaks & Gaps**
    - Current streak: "5-day workout streak 🔥"
    - Longest streak this period
    - Longest gap between workouts
    - Average rest days

**Commit:** "Phase 4: Replace consistency score with actionable insights"

---

### Phase 5: Anomaly Detection Mini-Section (Commit 5)
**Show outlier workouts clearly**

**ADD NEW FUNCTION:** `render_anomaly_detection_section(brief, classified_df, time_period)`

**Location:** Between Consistency Analysis and Scatter Plot

**Features:**
- Summary card: "⚠️ 3 outliers detected (5% of workouts in last 7 days)"
- Expandable table showing outlier workouts:
  - Date, Activity Type, Distance, Pace, Reason
  - Reason examples: "Pace >3 std dev from cluster center", "Distance >50 miles"
- Visual indicator (⚠️ marker) on scatter plot for outliers

**Commit:** "Phase 5: Add anomaly detection mini-section"

---

### Phase 6: K-means Scatter Plot Visualization (Commit 6)
**Beautiful, intuitive clustering visualization**

**ADD NEW FUNCTION:** `render_kmeans_scatter_plot(classified_df)`

**Location:** Bottom of page, replaces classification demo

**Features:**
- **Axes:** Choose orientation that maximizes cluster separation
  - Test both: Distance(X) vs Pace(Y) and Pace(X) vs Distance(Y)
  - Use auto-scaling to show maximum visual separation
- **Background:** Cream color (`#faf9f6`)
- **Cluster markers:**
  - Star (⭐) at each cluster center
  - Labels: "Run", "Walk", "Hybrid" positioned clearly
  - Different colors per cluster: Blue (#1976d2), Green (#388e3c), Orange (#ff9800)
- **Data points:**
  - Colored by cluster assignment
  - Outliers: Red X markers (❌)
  - Hover tooltip shows: Date, Type, Distance, Pace, Duration, Calories
- **Legend:** Below X-axis, not crowded
- **Explanation text:**
  - "This chart shows how the AI separates Runs from Walks"
  - "Each dot is one workout, positioned by its pace and distance"
  - "Stars show cluster centers - the AI groups workouts near each star"

**Commit:** "Phase 6: Add K-means scatter plot with cream background"

---

### Phase 7: Final Polish & Testing (Commit 7)
**Clean up headings, test all functionality**

1. Review all section headings for redundancy
2. Ensure consistent spacing between sections
3. Test with different time periods (7d, 30d, 90d, 365d)
4. Test with empty data scenarios
5. Test goal setting persistence across page refreshes
6. Verify all tooltips and hover interactions work
7. Commit: "Phase 7: Final polish and heading cleanup"
