## Visual Design Principles

### **Progressive Disclosure**
- **Surface Level**: High-level system flows
- **Intermediate Level**: Component interactions  
- **Deep Level**: Implementation details
- **Expert Level**: Source code and parameters

### **Multi-Audience Support**
- **Color Coding**: Consistent across all diagrams
- **Icon System**: Recognizable symbols for AI components
- **Layered Information**: Multiple levels of detail
- **Cross-References**: Links between related concepts

### **Accessibility Features**
- **Alt Text**: Comprehensive diagram descriptions
- **High Contrast**: Colors suitable for color-blind users
- **Text Labels**: All visual elements have text equivalents
- **Multiple Formats**: Mermaid diagrams work across platforms

## Integration with Documentation

### **MkDocs Integration**
All diagrams use Mermaid syntax supported by MkDocs with the `pymdownx.superfences` extension:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - pymdownx.superfences:
      custom_fences:
        - name: mermaid
          class: mermaid
          format: !!python/name:pymdownx.superfences.fence_code_format
```

### **GitHub Integration**
Mermaid diagrams render natively in GitHub markdown, making documentation viewable directly in the repository.

### **Export Options**
- **SVG**: For high-quality prints and presentations
- **PNG**: For web integration and thumbnails  
- **PDF**: For comprehensive documentation packages
- **Interactive**: Live diagrams in documentation sites

## Maintenance Guidelines

### **Updates Required When**:
- New AI algorithms added to the system
- Architecture changes affect component relationships
- User feedback indicates diagram improvements needed
- New transparency features implemented

### **Version Control**:
- All diagrams stored in git for change tracking
- Major updates documented in changelog
- Backwards compatibility maintained for documentation links

### **Quality Assurance**:
- Regular review against actual system implementation
- User testing for comprehension and clarity
- Technical review for accuracy and completeness

These visual diagrams serve as a comprehensive resource for understanding, explaining, and improving the AI systems that power the Fitness Intelligence Platform.
