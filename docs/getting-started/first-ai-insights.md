## Step 2: Understanding Your Insights (5 minutes)

### üéØ Focus Area Suggestions

**What you'll see:**
```
üéØ FOCUS AREA: Building Consistency
Try to establish a regular workout schedule
Based on: Analysis of your workout frequency
```

This tells you what the system thinks you should focus on:
- **Building Consistency** - if your workouts are irregular
- **Adding Frequency** - if you're consistent but infrequent
- **Optimizing Performance** - if you're already very consistent

### üìà Trend Analysis

**What you'll see:**
```
üìà TRENDING: Calorie Burn Improving
+15% increase over the last 30 days
Based on: Statistical analysis of recent workouts
```

This shows how your performance is changing:
- **Improving trends** - metrics getting better over time
- **Declining trends** - areas that might need attention
- **Stable patterns** - consistent performance

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance Alerts

**What you'll see:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è All systems normal
Your recent workout patterns look consistent
```

This highlights anything unusual:
- **All normal** - everything looks typical for you
- **Unusual patterns** - something different from your usual routine
- **Data quality alerts** - potential problems with imported data

## Step 3: Exploring Workout Categorization (3 minutes)

### Understanding Workout Types

The dashboard automatically sorts your workouts into categories:

- **Real Runs**: Focused running (usually 8-12 min/mile pace)
- **Walking/Hiking**: Leisurely activities (usually 20-28 min/mile pace)
- **Mixed Activities**: Combined running and walking
- **Outliers**: Unusual workouts that don't fit normal patterns

### Why This Matters

Categorization helps you:
- **Track different activity types** separately
- **See patterns** in what kinds of exercise you prefer
- **Identify outliers** that might be data errors
- **Get better trend analysis** for each activity type

### Interactive Demo

Try the classification demo:
1. Look for the "Workout Classification" section
2. Click on different example workouts
3. See why each was categorized the way it was
4. Notice the confidence scores (how sure the system is)

## Step 4: Getting Explanations (5 minutes)

### "How was this calculated?" Links

Throughout the dashboard, you'll see links that explain:
- **What method was used** - in simple terms
- **Why this conclusion** was reached
- **How confident** the system is
- **What you can do** to improve accuracy

### Providing Feedback

If you see something that looks wrong:
1. **Click on the classification** to see the reasoning
2. **Use feedback buttons** to report errors
3. **Suggest corrections** if the category seems wrong
4. **Help improve** the system for future analysis
