# Quick Start Guide

Get your Fitness Dashboard running in minutes and start analyzing your workout data!

## What You'll Accomplish

In about 10 minutes, you'll:

- ðŸ”§ **Set up the dashboard** on your computer
- ðŸ“Š **Import your workout data** from fitness apps
- ðŸ§  **See personalized insights** about your fitness patterns
- ðŸ“ˆ **Understand trends** in your performance over time
- ðŸ’¡ **Get suggestions** for improving your fitness routine

## Prerequisites

- âœ… Python 3.10+ installed
- âœ… Dependencies installed (see [Installation](installation.md))
- âœ… MySQL server running locally

## Step 1: Set Up the Database

Create the database that will store your workout data:

```bash
python scripts/init.py
```

This will create the database and tables needed to store your workout data.

    You should see: `Database 'sweat' created successfully`

## Step 2: Import Your Workout Data

### Option A: Use Your Own Data (Recommended)

1. **Export your data**: Get your workout history as CSV from [MapMyRun](https://www.mapmyfitness.com/workout/export/csv)
2. **Replace the sample file**: Copy your CSV file to `src/user2632022_workout_history.csv`
3. **Import it**:

```bash
python scripts/update_db.py
```

This will analyze your workouts and categorize them automatically.

!!! tip "Linux or Windows"
    Set `FITNESS_DASHBOARD_ENV=development` before running the script so the app uses your local MySQL credentials. Otherwise, provide the `RDS_*` environment variables for a remote database connection.

### Option B: Try the Demo

Skip data import for now and explore with the built-in demo data.

## Step 3: Start the Dashboard

Launch your fitness dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
```

Open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8501**

You'll see the main dashboard with insights about your workouts!

## Step 4: Explore Your Dashboard

3. **[Explore common tasks](../user-guide/user-journeys.md)** - discover what you can do with the dashboard
4. **[Try advanced features](../user-guide/sql-queries.md)** - custom analysis and queries

## Troubleshooting

### **Dashboard won't start**
