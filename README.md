## Project Description
The Fitness Dashboard is a web application designed to help users track and manage their workout routines. It provides features such as logging exercises, tracking progress, and visualizing workout data.

## Features
- Exercise logging with customizable workout classification
- Progress tracking with charts and statistics
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop use

## Installation 
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dagny/fitness-dashboard.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd fitness-dashboard
    ```
3. Install Poetry if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
    ```
- Make note of whether $HOME was successfully modified; if not, poetry may be installed in another location. For example, for my mac poetry is here:
    ```bash
    ~/.local/bin/poetry
    ```
**Instalation - A)** typical route of setting up virtual environment w project dependeincies  
4a. Create and activate a virtual environment for the project. For example, I typically use venv and am using the name ".st-db":
```bash
    python3 -m venv .st-db    
    source .st-db/bin/activate
```
5a. Within the virtual environment, install dependencies using Poetry (set to package-mode ):
```bash
    poetry install                  #If dev
```
    or
```bash
    poetry install --no-dev         #If prod
```
**Instalation - B)** use direnv to auto-load the python env and env vars when you cd int othe folder
4b. Install `direnv` installed at the shell-level, if you haven't already
```bash
brew install direnv

```
Add the hook to your shell config (`~/.zshrc`):
```bash
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"
```
Direnv needs to be installed once system-wide and will work everywhere.

5b. Navigate to project folder and run:
```bash
poetry init
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry install
```

6b. Add this `.envrc`:

```bash
VENV_PATH=$(poetry env info -p)
source "$VENV_PATH/bin/activate"
export STREAMLIT_THEME="dark"
dotenv
```

7b. Then:

```bash
touch .env
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
direnv allow
```

ðŸŽ‰ Now: Environment is **fully auto-activated, clean, and predictable.** 

## Usage
This usage will work seamlessly if you, like me, have a MapMyRun account that you want to sync. If so, replace the CSV export in the `src` directory and edit the default file in `pyproject.toml`. The overall logic is largely platform agnostic and I'm working on a version of this app that lets you flexibly map the columns of your own, custom-sourced CSV file to the database schema in this app, which is industry-standard and fairly platform-agnostic. 

To follow along:
=> **After cloning the repo, the next milestones are:**  


### 1. SETUP LOCAL DB FOR TESTING  
Run "init.py" from main project directory to CREATE DATABASE & TABLES
```bash
python init.py
```
**What this script does:**  
- Loads `pyproject.toml` and looks for `.streamlit folder`; if none found, creates it and the `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file with db credentials...  
- Loads `MYSQL_USER` and `MYSQL_PWD` env vars, and sets them to *"db_user"* and *"db_password"* in `secrets.toml` file if none found  
- Checks for an existing database, `sweat`, if none create   
- Create table, `workout_summary` if doensn't exist. tbl_schema is hard-coded but could easily be read in via file upload.  
- Print the number of rows in the table & Exit   

**Verify database connection after updating credentials file** 
*Remember to edit credentials in `.streamlit/config.toml`*  
You may want to check the local database to ensure you have the login, database, and tables setup as expected. 

### 2. UPDATE DB 
Run "update_db.py" from main project directory to UPDATE DATABASE:
```bash
python update_db.py
```

### 3. RUN DASHBOARD AND VISIT AT`http://localhost:8501`** 
Run "dashboard.py" from main project directory to SHOW DASHBOARD:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
